The Front End Folder contains some of my front end devlopment projects:
*In the Bootstrap folder you will find my landing page for a faux coffee blog. 
*Under the JavaScript Section I created two front ends for games using Bootstrap and JavaScript: Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect Four.
 Both Games are functional and can detect victories.
